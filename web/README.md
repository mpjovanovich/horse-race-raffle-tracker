# Web Architecture

This web application is built using React, TypeScript, and Next.js, following modern frontend development practices.

## Architecture Layers

- The **Presentation Layer** (implemented in `components` and `pages`) handles the user interface and user interactions:

  - UI components and layouts
  - Page routing and navigation
  - User input handling
  - Client-side state management

- The **Data Layer** (implemented in `services` and `hooks`) manages data operations and API communication:
  - API integration
  - Data fetching and caching
  - State management
  - Data transformation

## Key Features

- Server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design
- Client-side routing

## Benefits

- Improved performance through SSR
- Enhanced developer experience with TypeScript
- Maintainable and scalable codebase
- Optimized user experience
- Easy integration with the API layer
- Decoupled from the API layer
